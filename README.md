This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Follow the below steps for run the project : 

1) set Node Version  20.14.0 using command --   ## nvm use 20.14.0
2) install packages using command --   ## yarn
3) yarn run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.



Now you're all set to build awesome movie backend server! ðŸŒŸ
